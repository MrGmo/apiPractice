# apiPractice

Hi there!

This repo holds several fetches to public API's. There's several different API calls simply because I needed to practice how to destructure the objects that were returned. I also needed to learn how to attach query parameters and read API documentation. 

Tech used: HTML, Node.js, Javascript

If you go through the API's you'll notice my evolution from using nested fetches to more modern async await syntax. Overall, a really great hands on introduction to API's and backend web dev.

Optimizations:

I probably should have created more slick front ends to go along with my API requests, but that wasn't really my focus during these exercises.

Lessons Learned:
  1. Destructuring objects from API requests.
  2. Fetches and async await.
